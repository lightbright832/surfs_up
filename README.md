## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose:
Opening a surf shop is an exciting endeavor. While the surf shop could represent a promising business venture it is important to take weather into consideration. In Oahu the weather has to become a factor in any business venture relating to outdoor sports. If the rain is going to affect business than it would not be a smart financial investment. The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the weather and percipitation in Oahu. The analysis can be used for future cities in the way it has been written.
