## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose:
Opening a surf shop is an exciting endeavor. While the surf shop could represent a promising business venture it is important to take weather into consideration. In Oahu the weather has to become a factor in any business venture relating to outdoor sports. If the rain is going to affect business than it would not be a smart financial investment. The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the weather and percipitation in Oahu. The analysis can be used for future cities in the way it has been written.

## Summary:
Based on the statistics retrieved from this analysis it is clear to see that Oahu experiences more rain in December. June shows a lower average percipitation than December thus this is a great time for surfing. The surf shop would not be greatly impacted if it were open during the summer months. To further this analysis it would also be beneficial to run a query about past hurricanes and other natural disasters in the area. Historical weather data helps to gauge when the shop should be open and when it is best to close for the "winter" months.
